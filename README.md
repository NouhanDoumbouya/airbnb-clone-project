## 🔒 API Security

Security is critical in handling sensitive data and preventing abuse.

- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth for secure session handling.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access to routes (e.g., host-only actions).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and brute-force attacks.
- **Input Validation**: Prevents SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks.
- **HTTPS**: Encrypts communication between client and server.
- **CSRF/XSRF Protection**: Prevents cross-site request forgery for state-changing actions.

Each of these measures ensures that user data, payments, and application integrity remain protected.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment)** automates code testing, building, and deployment.

- **Why it matters**: Reduces manual work, speeds up feedback loops, and ensures code reliability.
- **What it does**:
  - Runs tests automatically on pull requests.
  - Deploys to staging or production after successful builds.
- **Tools used**:
  - **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflow for build, test, and deploy.
  - **Docker**: Containerizes application for consistent deployment.
  - **Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean**: (Optional) Hosts the deployed application.
